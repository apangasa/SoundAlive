This territory consists of a wooded hillside (with railroad tracks running through it) that comes down to a road, with a cow pasture on the other side of the road. The pasture is bordered on one side by more woods, and on the other side by a dirt road and a narrow strip of trees. The pasture extends down to a marshy area along Willsboro Bay, but I only heard the bird sing down at that end of the pasture once. It normally sings from the hillside, the narrow strip of trees along the pasture, or from the other tract of woods on the other side of the pasture.

With some slow stalking managed to get close to its tree. Things quite wet so could move silently and could slip under the banana trees without disturbing the bird.  Finally got a good clear, long sequence of M. fuscus song.  The bird was singing in lower limbs of aa mango tree.  I played back some of the songs  a good strong response.  The bird flew down into the banama and upon seeming me did a quick exit.  Did not come down again but returned to mango tree and sang loudly (for and M. fuscus).  This is the first positive response I have gotten to playback with these birds.  Normally they will look but do nothing or will depart.  The trembler too is not overly sensitive to playback, at least so for.  While recording the M. fuscus, gusts of wind swept over ther Forestiere ridge and towards end, rain began.  The M. fuscus kept singing.  Finally it stopped as the shower let up.  Returned to Forestiere.-----

Note: On LNS reel, sounds from 0:00 - 1:58 from Tape 40; sounds from 1:58 - 9:50 from Tape 41. Why is this? Because Tom used sounds from Tape 40 (July 2) as playback, and taped the owl's responses on Tape 41. This is the case for the first half of  Tape 41. The second half of Tape 41 is also O. ingens, taped on the next day, July 3. (LNS 92658); this completes Tape 41. The next cut (LNS 92659) is also O. ingens from July 3; Tom used the rest of Tape 40 to record the early morning of July 3.
